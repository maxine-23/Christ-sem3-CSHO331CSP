## 2. Cloning Projects using GitHub

GitHub is a platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows users to host and review code, manage projects, and collaborate on software development.

### Steps to Clone a Project:

1. Go to the GitHub repository page.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button.
3. Copy the **HTTPS** or **SSH** link.
4. Open terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
5. Navigate into the cloned project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```

### Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
```

This will download the complete project to your local machine for development or testing.
