# Cybersecurity Notes

## 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks usually aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information; extort money from users; or interrupt normal business processes.

## 2. Types of Hackers

Hackers are generally categorized based on their intent and legality of actions:

### a. White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)
- Work with organizations to improve security.
- Identify vulnerabilities in systems and fix them.
- Often work as security analysts, penetration testers, or cybersecurity consultants.

### b. Black Hat Hackers
- Operate illegally with malicious intent.
- Exploit system vulnerabilities for personal or financial gain.
- Activities include data breaches, identity theft, ransomware attacks.

### c. Grey Hat Hackers
- Operate between ethical and unethical behavior.
- May exploit vulnerabilities without permission but not for personal gain.
- Sometimes report vulnerabilities after discovering them, but initial access is unauthorized.

## 3. Subtypes of Hackers

### Under Black Hat:
- **Script Kiddies**: Inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or scripts.
- **Hacktivists**: Use hacking to promote political or social agendas.
- **Cyber Terrorists**: Cause widespread fear or disruption, often targeting infrastructure.
- **State-Sponsored Hackers**: Work for governments to steal data or sabotage.

### Under White Hat:
- **Security Researchers**: Find and report vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testers (Pen Testers)**: Simulate cyberattacks to test defenses.
- **Bug Bounty Hunters**: Report bugs to companies for rewards.

### Under Grey Hat:
- **Freelance Hackers**: Sometimes cross the line without malicious intent.

## 4. Types of Cyber Threats

### a. Malware
- Malicious software such as viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware.

### b. Phishing
- Fraudulent emails or messages that trick users into revealing sensitive information.

### c. Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)
- Intercepts communication between two parties to steal or alter information.

### d. Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
- Overloads a system or network, making it inaccessible.

### e. SQL Injection
- Injects malicious SQL queries to manipulate or access databases.

### f. Zero-Day Exploit
- Attacks systems using previously unknown vulnerabilities.

### g. Insider Threats
- Employees or insiders intentionally or unintentionally compromise security.

### h. Ransomware
- Encrypts a victim's data and demands payment to restore access.

## 5. Conclusion
Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field requiring constant vigilance. Understanding hacker types and cyber threats is critical for implementing effective defenses and ensuring data integrity.
